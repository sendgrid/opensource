# Hacktoberfest 2018 Ideas

# Purpose

We’re trying something new for Hacktoberfest 2018.  This repo is intended to be a place to share/capture/inspire new projects within SendGrid’s developer community.  The ideas here present an opportunity for developers who want to work on a bigger project.

To be considered as part of Hacktoberfest, you will need to publish the project under an open source license.

There is no requirement that you host your project under the SendGrid GitHub organization.  

# How Do I Use This Repo?

* Submit an issue that describes the solution that you’d like to work on.
* Our DX team will review and comment on the issue.
* The DX team will approve the solution to be part of Hacktoberfest
* Start coding.

# Swag & Recognition

As you develop a solution, please share with us where you’re publishing the project.  Like contributing to any Hacktoberfest project, we’ll send you some special edition SendGrid Hacktoberfest swag.  These projects will likely qualify in our “difficulty: hard” category.

As an additional reward, we’d love to write a blog post about your project and promote it.
